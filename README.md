# Deji-Batch-photo-resizer-app
is a simple Python program that allows you to resize multiple images at once. To use the program, simply download and unpack the zip file into your computer, and then run the "app.py" script.

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the desired width and height for the resized images, and then select the folder containing the images you wish to resize. The program will automatically resize all images in the selected folder and save the resized images with the same filenames in the same folder.
